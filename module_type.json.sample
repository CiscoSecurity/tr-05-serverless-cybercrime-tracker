CyberCrime has been\n      around since early 1990, and is staffed by a dedicated, motivated\n      group of sysops, who actually CARE about the future of our scene.\n\n  *   CCi (CyberCrime International) is the world's oldest and largest\n      underground message network, with 147 member BBSes in 56 area codes,\n      25 states (US), 25 countries, 8 provinces (Canada) and 7 continents.\n\n  *   50 Message Echos, ALL of which are ACTIVE!  Since this network covers\n      such a wide range of topics, you are encouraged to carry ONLY those\n      areas which you and your users are specifically interested in.\n      Currently averaging over THREE THOUSAND POSTS PER MONTH, netwide.\n\n\n      WHO MAY RECEIVE IT?\n\n  *   ANY established BBS may join CyberCrime without any restrictions.\n      Please note:  Only truly DEDICATED and MOTIVATED sysops need bother\n      applying for this network.  Once you have joined, you (or your users)\n      are expected to remain at least SOMEWHAT active within the echos on\n      a continual basis.  Low Activity is tolerable - Laziness is not.\n\n  *   ANY individual may join CyberCrime, and receive mail packets via\n      either FidoNet standard (if you already have a point system setup, or\n      have an old copy of a bbs software you wish to use), or QWK standard.\n      Packets can be sent to you via E-mail file attaches or FTP.  We also\n      have mailing lists available for those who wish to take part in only\n      a few select topic areas.\n\n  *   No silly rules restricting you from joining, either:  Carry as MANY\n      \"other\" nets as you like - we're not insecure.  :)  Don't want to\n      make CCi the backbone of your whole bbs?  Who cares!  Do you have a\n      NUP, require real info from your users, or take a week to validate\n      them thru NUV or voice validation?  Hey, that's YOUR prerogative.\n      Want to carry JUST five or six echos, and nothing else?  Go for it!\n      CyberCrime is about freedom and choice - Not restrictions.\n\n\n      HOW DO YOU GET YOUR MAIL?\n\n  *   CyberCrime is NOT bbs software specific!  Our goal is to make this\n      network available to ANYONE who wishes to carry it.  To further that\n      aim, we offer CyberCrime via FidoNet (FTS-001) Standard, QWK-Mail\n      Networking, and to WWIV sysops via our gateway.  Alternate schemes\n      are continually in development, including NNTP/UseNet-format mail\n      transfers, and web-based message retrieval.\n\n  *   Fido-Standard Mail Packets are typically transferred via e-mail,\n      utilizing Fido2Internet, InternetRex, Allfix, TransX, or standard\n      MIME or UUEncoded messages.  Other schemes include the old-fashioned\n      mode of polling from a local or long-distance hub, packet transfers\n      from an FTP Site, or Direct-IP Polling from our Telnet host.\n\n  *   QWK Network packets are transferred via e-mail or FTP.\n\n  *   WWIV Network packets are transferred via the internet, using WWIV's\n      PPP Project software package in conjunction with our gateway system.\n\n\n      WANT MORE INFORMATION?
